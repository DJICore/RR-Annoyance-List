## Rec Room Annoyance List

Welcome! This is a community-driven list for Rec Room players. It helps you quickly find players and see which in-game behaviors or “annoyances” they’re known for, so you can decide who to invite, mute, avoid, or just be prepared for.

This project is designed to be used on the website (GitHub Pages). You don’t need to clone or run anything locally.

### Use it online
- Open the site: Visit the GitHub Pages site for this repository. If you’re viewing this on GitHub, check the repository details for the website link.
- Browse players: Use the table and search tools to find players by name.
- See annoyances: Each player entry lists reported annoyances (e.g., spamming, griefing, loud mic, etc.)
- Filter and sort: Use the built-in filters, sorting, and toolbar to narrow down results.

### Contribute — Insert Players
Your input keeps the list useful and up to date.

- Click “Insert Players” on the site.
- Add the player’s name and select their annoyances.
- Submit to add them to the list. New entries will become visible to everyone using the site once they've been reviewed and approved manually.

### What this is (and isn’t)
- Community-maintained: Entries reflect community reports and may evolve over time.
- Not official: This is not affiliated with Rec Room or any official moderation.
- Be respectful: Share factual, constructive info. Don’t harass or dox.

### Questions or fixes
If you spot a problem on the site (broken link, layout issue, etc.), open an issue on GitHub with a clear description and screenshot if possible. Feature ideas are welcome.

### Privacy and etiquette
- Only include public in-game names.

- Keep notes concise, objective, and helpful to other players.

Thanks for helping the community play smarter—and kinder.
